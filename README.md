# Wine Quality Prediction using Random Forest

## Overview

This project aims to predict the quality of red wine based on its chemical properties using various machine learning algorithms. The dataset contains various features like fixed acidity, volatile acidity, citric acid, residual sugar, etc., and a quality score.

## Data

The dataset used is `winequality.csv`, which contains information on red wine variants. The dataset includes the following features:

*   **Fixed acidity**
*   **Volatile acidity**
*   **Citric acid**
*   **Residual sugar**
*   **Chlorides**
*   **Free sulfur dioxide**
*   **Total sulfur dioxide**
*   **Density**
*   **pH**
*   **Sulphates**
*   **Alcohol**
*   **Quality** (target variable)
